    <h1>Guessing Game Assignment Day 1</h1>
      <p>This assignment was created to demonstrate the use of the command line and basic JavaScript.

      <h3>Using Bash/Command Line</h3>
      <p>I was able to create a directory of projects. Within projects directory I created a folder called '201d2'. Within that directory I thought I crated a file called "assignment 1". Which now contains this very file intitled 'index.html'. I used the command atom "index.html" to open the project in atom. Fairily different from Fish.</p>
      <h3>Time to Quiz-Splain'</h3>
      <p>Essentially, this quiz followed the format that I drew up in my design. It uses userName to store players names. It then uses prompt and alert to pop up questions and give feedback. It also keeps track of how many questions were answered correctly. When a correct answer is given the score total increases or decreases accordingly.</p>
